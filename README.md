Module 2 Challenge for Penn Data Analytics Bootcamp
Notes:
- I used this source to help with the looping through multiple tabs: https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/macro-to-loop-through-all-worksheets-in-a-workbook-feef14e3-97cf-00e2-538b-5da40186e2b
- I also spoke to Buster and Justin who helped me troubleshoot the looping

SECOND SUBMISSION - Added Conditional Formatting to the code
